Call your new project 'Interactive badge'.\n\n![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jerry914/interactive-badge/master/en/images/badge-name.png)\n\n+ You should now see the code editor. To draw an image on your micro:bit when it's powered on, drag a `show leds` block from the code area (on the left) inside the `start` block.\n\n![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jerry914/interactive-badge/master/en/images/badge-draw.png)\n\n+ To create an image to display, click on leds that you want to light up:\n\n![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jerry914/interactive-badge/master/en/images/badge-pattern.png)\n\n+ Your code will run automatically in the emulator on the left:\n\n![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jerry914/interactive-badge/master/en/images/badge-emulator.png)\n\n+ You can also test your code on the micro:bit itself! To do this, click 'Download' on the menu at the left of the screen.\n\n![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jerry914/interactive-badge/master/en/images/badge-download.png)\n\nThis will create and download a `.hex` file that will run on your micro:bit.\n\n\n+ Use the USB cable to plug your micro:bit into your computer. You should then see your micro:bit appear in your computer's file manager as a USB drive. \n\n![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jerry914/interactive-badge/master/en/images/badge-drive.png)\n\n+ If you are using the micro:bit uploader then the `.hex` file will be automatically copied to the micro:bit. Check with your volunteer if you're not sure. \n\nOtherwise you will need to copy the `.hex` file to the micro:bit.\n\nIf you are using __Internet Explorer__ you can choose `Save as` from the menu that appears at the bottom of your browser and then select the micro:bit drive:\n\n![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jerry914/interactive-badge/master/en/images/badge-save-explorer.png)\n\nIf you are using __Google Chrome__ you can click on the arrow after the downloaded file and choose 'Show in folder' and then drag the highlighted file to the micro:bit drive:\n\n![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jerry914/interactive-badge/master/en/images/badge-save-chrome.png)\n\n+ A light on the back of your micro:bit will flash while the file is being copied. Once this has stopped your program will run. You can click the reset button on the back of your micro:bit to restart the program.\n\n![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jerry914/interactive-badge/master/en/images/badge-reset.jpg)\n\n+ You should now see your image on the micro:bit. If you prefer, you can remove the USB cable from your micro:bit, and attach the battery. The program will be saved on the micro:bit.\n\n![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jerry914/interactive-badge/master/en/images/badge-battery.jpg)\n\n\n\nYou don't need an account to save your stuff! Your project will automatically be saved in the browser, you can click on `Projects` to see your projects. \n\nYou can also click save to download your project as a `.hex` file which contains your project:\n\n![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jerry914/interactive-badge/master/en/images/badge-save.png)\n\nTo load your project on another computer, click 'Projects' and then 'Import file' and select your `.hex` file.\n\n![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jerry914/interactive-badge/master/en/images/badge-import.png)\n\n\n",
